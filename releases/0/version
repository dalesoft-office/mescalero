0.21.0
#
# The first line always contains mescalero version
#   major - new incompatible API
#   minor - additional methods
#   build - just patches
#
# You should rely on the file /releases/[major version number]/version
#
# Example:
#
# 1. Your software uses mescalero version 0.18.0, so major is "0".
# 2. Look at the /releases/0/version that says "0.21.0". It's newer
# 3. Download /releases/0/mscl_*.zip, unzip and check SHA256 hash with files.sha256sum
