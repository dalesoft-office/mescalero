0.21.0
#
# First line always contains mescalero version
#   major - new incompatible API
#   minor - additional methods
#   build - just patches
#
# If the major version number has changed, and you need the previous 
# version, then the 'version' file of a similar format can be found 
# in the folder /releases/[major version number].
#
# Example:
#
# We have mescalero version 0.18.0, and /releases/version says "1.12.5". Incompatible.
# Look at the /releases/0/version that says "0.21.0". Compatible and newer - download
# /releases/0/mscl_*.zip
